	"NL_desc":"Ondanks recent archeologisch onderzoek geeft het secreet zijn geheimen nog niet allemaal prijs. Het blijft gissen naar de exacte bouwgeschiedenis van het oudste deel van het belfort. Alles wijst erop dat men aanvankelijk de intentie had om in de onderste bouwlaag van de toren een halfondergrondse verdieping te maken, met toegang, venster en latrine. Om onbekende redenen werd dit nooit volledig uitgevoerd.

In 1402 werd het secreet als archiefkamer ingericht. Het stadsbestuur bewaarde hier in versterkte en vastgeketende koffers de kostbare privilegiën die de rechten van de stad beschreven.

De ruimte wordt overspannen door een zwaar kruisribgewelf met een ronde opening waarlangs de klokken naar boven werden gehesen.

Tijdens WO II bracht de Duitse bezetter in deze ruimte een betonnen tussenvloer aan. Het onderste niveau deed toen dienst als commandopost. Een deuropening gaf toegang naar de onderaardse gangen die de Duitsers gebruikten om hun schuilkelder in het belfort te bereiken.

Vier stenen torenwachters (een gezel van de Sint-Jorisgilde, een gezel van de Sint-Sebastiaansgilde, een lid van de vleeshouwersnering en een stadstrompetter) sieren sinds 1339 de hoeken van de toren. In 1870 werd de laatste originele wachter naar beneden gehaald. Samen met drie gipsen afgietsels, gemaakt voor de restauratie in 1913, staat hij nu in het secreet opgesteld.",
